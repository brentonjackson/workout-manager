# Workout Manager (WIP)

2021 Update: Using this app to experiment with authentication and other features as I build a better version. Currently using AWS Cognito and AWS Amplify for Google sign-in.

One blocker I have with this version is how I've designed my database. The schema is very simple and not useful if I wanted to perform any kind of data analysis on my workouts, like tracking progression for a particular exercise for example.
I'm learning more about database design and structure to make improvements to this.

App built to organize your workouts. If you're like me, you have different workouts and over time you tweak them because
you may like one exercise over the other, or you have to switch things up due to equipment access.
This app keeps all of the different workouts for different situations in one place.

Also my first full-stack application, and first time doing any thing on the backend. On this journey, I always ask myself why before I learn anything or do anything. Why use a framework when I can do the same things with vanilla JS skills?
Why learn how the backend works?

What dispelled the mystery behind back-end development for me was doing a project as a front-end developer with two other devs. I realized that not knowing anything actually hindered my front-end capabilities, and it's much more efficient for fewer people to know more than for more specialized people to have a smaller bredth for small projects. I didn't like the feeling of not being able to contribute in a particular area, so that was the inspiration behind tackling a fullstack project headfirst. Plus, I needed a digital alternative to using my notes app to keep track of my workouts!

More features to come!

... and more projects to come!
